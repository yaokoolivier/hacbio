# Topics Covered: Coding Syntax, Data types and Data Structures
# Instructions
# Form a team of at least 5 people with different Programming language
# Using either R and Python. I.e, produce the solution with only one of R and Python
# Use any data structure of your choice to organize the following information
# Your names
# Your Slackrname
# Your email
# Your hobby
# Your countries
# Your discipline
# Your preferred Programming language
# Donâ€™t use functions, loops, conditionals or any complex concepts
# Your code should include a final print statement that prints the organized output in a logical and understandable way
